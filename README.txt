SpaceX Launch API Project! This will eventually get more features but am currently working on another project that has more priority at the moment

What this does currently
- Retrieves SpaceX Launches (v5)
- Displays Launch data in a chart with filters
- "Load more" on demand and loads 10 launches per load

Future features
- Expanding chart filters
- Filter / sorting Launches
- Component for upcoming launches in a quick overview
- More relevant information in the Launch cards
- Dedicated launch details view
